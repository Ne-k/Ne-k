# Welcome to my profile, 

> I mainly code in JS but I'm starting to use Python, TS and more. I am **the worst** bot developer there is but manage to have a [bot](https://top.gg/bot/752306970467237970) that is over 3k servers

## Some things about me: 

> Hey there, I'm Nek, the developer for [ToD](https://top.gg/bot/752306970467237970). For starters, I'm a Vietnamese asian and a complete computer nerd and idiot, I spend most of my time working on ToD and patching bugs, but I am also an anime weeb, you can view my anime list [here](https://myanimelist.net/animelist/NekWasTaken).
