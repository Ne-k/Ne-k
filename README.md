> Hey there, I'm Nek, the developer for [ToD](https://tod.nek.wtf). For starters, I'm a Vietnamese asian and a complete computer nerd and idiot, I spend most of my time working on ToD and patching bugs, but I am also an anime weeb, you can view my anime list [here](https://myanimelist.net/animelist/NekWasTaken).
