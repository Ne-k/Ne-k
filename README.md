# Welcome to my profile, 

> I mainly code in JS but I'm starting to use Python, TS and more. I am **the worst** bot developer there is but manage to have a [bot](https://top.gg/bot/752306970467237970) that is over 1k servers

## Some things about me: 

> I am a complete computer geek and anime weeb, my favorite anime (so far) has got to be [kimetsu no yaiba](https://kitsu.io/anime/kimetsu-no-yaiba) and [Toradora](https://kitsu.io/anime/toradora). I have a bot by the name of [ToD (Truth or Dare)](https://top.gg/bot/752306970467237970) which as I mentioned, has over 1k servers. Another bot I'm also working on, is [Maru](https://top.gg/bot/820526612713177108) which is a somewhat moderation bot and anime bot.
